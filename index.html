                <h1>Hi I'm Jacob Bellows</h1>
                <p>I love learning and exploring the unknown whether that's an actual place or a new idea. I love to write, code, make maps, develop apps, play music, bake, and travel. I have a silly motto for myself that keeps me motivated: 'Time is my only enemy.' Perhaps I've seen too many movies for this to be my motto, but something about having only time itself as my enemy empowers me to make the most of my life. This website is here for anyone who wants to follow my progress in this quest called life.</p>
